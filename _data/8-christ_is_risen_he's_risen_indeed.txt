How can it be, the One who died

Has borne our sin through sacrifice
D            C#/A      Bm       F#m        
To conquer every sting of death
Bm    C#/A   E    A
Sing, sing hallelujah

[Verse 2:]
A                 D       A
For joy awakes as dawning light
D                C#/A       Esus4 E
When Christ’s disciples lift their eyes
D         C#/A         Bm         F#m        
Alive He stands, their Friend and King
Bm      C#/A   E    A
Christ, Christ He is risen

[Chorus:]

Christ is risen, He is risen indeed!

Oh, sing hallelujah.

Christ is risen, He is risen indeed.

[Verse 3:]
A                D           A
Where doubt and darkness once had been
D                C#/A       Esus4 E
They saw Him and their hearts believed
D            C#/A      Bm       F#m        
But blessed are those who have not seen
Bm    C#/A   E    A
Yet, sing hallelujah

[Verse 4:]
A                      D       A
Once bound by fear now bold in faith
D                 C#/A      Esus4    E
They preached the truth and power of grace
D            C#/A     Bm         F#m        
And pouring out their lives they gained
Bm    C#/A   E    A
Life, life everlasting

[Bridge:]
C#/A                D
He’s alive, He’s alive!
E                     D
Heaven’s gates are opened wide.
C#/A        D
He’s alive, He’s alive!
E                D
Now in heaven glorified.
