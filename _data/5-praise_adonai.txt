[INTRO:]
{Am   F   C   G}

[Verse:]
Am            F
Who is like Him
                  C                  G
The Lion and the Lamb, seated on the throne
Am             F
Mountains bow down
            C                    G
Every ocean roars to the Lord of Hosts

[Chorus:]
F         Am           G
Praise Adonai from the rising of the sun
         Dm7          F G
'Til the end of every day
F         Am            G
Praise Adonai, all the nations of the earth
          Dm7          F   G            Bb
All the angels and the saints sing praise
