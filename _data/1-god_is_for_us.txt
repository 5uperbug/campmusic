D        
We won’t fear the battle

We won’t fear the night

We will walk the valley, with You by our side

You will go before us
G                 D
You will lead the way

We have found a refuge, only You can save

Sing with joy now: our God is for us
G            D           Bm              A
The Father’s love is a strong and mighty fortress

Raise your voice now, no love is greater
Em            D/F#              A                         
Who can stand against us if our God is for us

Even when I stumble
G           D
Even when I fall
G                D       Bm              A
Even when I turn back, still Your love is sure
{D}
You will not abandon
G                 D
You will not forsake

The Father’s love is a strong and mighty fortress

Raise your voice now, no love is greater
Em            D/F#              A                         
Who can stand against us if our God is for us

Neither height nor depth can separate us
Bm                  D/F#
Hell and death will not defeat us
G                            A      
He who gave His Son to free us
Bm              A
Holds me in His love

Raise your voice now, no love is greater
