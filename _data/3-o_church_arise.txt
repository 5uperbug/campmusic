[Verse 1:]
          D5                    G/B   A/C#        
O church, arise, and put your armor on;
         D/F#    G      Asus   D5
Hear the call of Christ our captain.
            D5                G/B      A/C#  
For now the weak can say that they are strong
       D/F#          G      Asus   D5
In the strength that God has given.
               G                 A 
With shield of faith and belt of truth,
             G/B                A/C# 
We'll stand against the devil's lies.
        D5                 G/B    A/C# 
An army bold, whose battle cry is love,
         D/F#    G      Asus   D5
Reaching out to those in darkness.

[Verse 2:]
            D5               G/B     A/C#        
Our call to war, to love the captive soul,
       D/F#      G      Asus   D5
But to rage against the captor;
            D5                    G/B     A/C#  
And with the sword that makes the wounded whole
        D/F#       G         Asus   D5
We will fight with faith and valor.
                G                A 
When faced with trials on ev'ry side,
            G/B        A/C# 
We know the outcome is secure,
                 D5                G/B      A/C# 
And Christ will have the prize for which He diedâ€”
   D/F#    G      Asus   D5
An inheritance of nations.

[Chorus:]
A                     G         D
Arise, shine for your light has come
A                     G    D
Arise, shine for the Risen Son
Bm              A          G         D/F#
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride
Em        Asus2      D 
Arise, o church arise!

[Verse 3:]
`Only keys here`
              Bm           G/B 
Come, see the cross, where love and mercy meet,
              Bm7           G/B 
As the Son of God is stricken;
              Bm              G/B 
Then see His foes lie crushed beneath His feet,
         Bm7           G/D
For the Conqueror has risen!
           G               A
And as the stone is rolled away,
           G/B              A/C#
And Christ emerges from the grave,
             D5              Em
This victory march continues till the day
      D/F#    G     Asus      D5    G/D
Ev'ry eye and heart shall see Him.

[Verse 4:]
`Band slowly builds up`
            D                    G/D
So Spirit, come, put strength in every stride;
     D         G/D   A/D  D
Give grace for every hurdle.
            D                 G/D
That we may run with faith to win the prize
     D       G/D      A/D  D
Of a servant good and faithful.
             G               A
As saints of old, still line the way,
          G/B              A/C#
Retelling triumphs of His grace,
              D5                Em
We hear their calls, and hunger for the day
      D/F#    G     Asus      D5    G/D
When with Christ we stand in Glory.


[Chorus:]
A                     G         D
Arise, shine for your light has come
A                     G    D
Arise, shine for the Risen Son
Bm              A          G         D/F#
Lift your eyes, we are His radiant bride
Em        Asus2      D 
Arise, o church arise!
`Twice`
